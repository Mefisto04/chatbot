## ChatBot Project

This project is a simple chatbot implemented in React, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling. The chatbot allows users to interact with predefined conversations and also provides an option to send custom messages. Below, we'll delve into the technical stack, Tailwind CSS usage, and an overview of the project structure.

### Technical Stack

- **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this project, React is used for creating the components and managing the state of the chatbot.

- **useState and useEffect Hooks**: These are React hooks used for managing state and side effects respectively. `useState` is used to manage state variables such as messages, input text, menu state, and current conversation. `useEffect` is utilized to handle side effects like fetching and storing messages in local storage.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework used for styling. It allows for rapid development by providing pre-defined utility classes that can be directly applied to HTML elements. Tailwind CSS classes are extensively used in this project for styling the user interface.

### Tailwind CSS Explanation

Tailwind CSS is used to style the components in this project. Here's a brief explanation of how Tailwind CSS is used in the code:

- **Utility Classes**: Tailwind CSS provides utility classes for various CSS properties. For example, `bg-gray-900` sets the background color to dark gray, `text-white` sets the text color to white, `p-4` sets padding to 4 units, `border-b` sets a bottom border, and so on.

- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS allows for easy creation of responsive designs using breakpoint-based classes. For instance, `md:hidden` hides an element on screens larger than medium size, `md:block` shows an element on medium screens and above.

### ChatBot Explanation

The chatbot in this project is designed to simulate conversations between a user and a chatbot. Conversations are predefined and stored as arrays of messages within the `conversations` array. Users can switch between different conversations by selecting them from the sidebar menu.

- **Message Sending**: Users can send custom messages by typing in the input field and clicking the "Send" button. Custom messages are displayed alongside predefined messages in the chat interface.

- **Local Storage**: Messages for each conversation are stored in the browser's local storage. This ensures that the chat history persists even when the page is refreshed.

### Project Structure

- **App Component**: The main component of the project. It manages the state of the chatbot, renders the user interface, and handles user interactions.

- **Sidebar**: Displays a list of available conversations and allows users to switch between them.

- **Chat Area**: Renders the conversation messages along with the input field for sending custom messages.

- **Message Component**: Represents an individual message in the chat interface, displaying the text and styling based on the sender (user or chatbot).
